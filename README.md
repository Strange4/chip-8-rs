## Compile it yourself

1. Install [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack)
2. Run `./build.sh`
3. Serve the `web/index.html` from a web server and enjoy!

## *WHY ALL IN RUST?

It's not completely in Rust... There is a lot of "glue" code that is generated by [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/) that generates a lot of the bindings between Rust and JS. However since all the source code is written in Rust. I'll count it as all in Rust.

This shows what is possible with just Rust (+ amazing glue tooling) and a few dependencies. The javascript included in this project only starts the wasm environment.
